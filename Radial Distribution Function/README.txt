The radial distribution function (RDF) of a protein in water is a way to show the distribution of water molecules around a protein's atoms.
The RDF (g(r)) of a protein in water shows the organization of water molecules around the protein's atoms. It can also be used to determine the local density of water.
It is important for understanding the structure, function, and folding properties of proteins.

Requirements:
1. GROMACS Package installed 
2. xtc file
3. tpr file
4. pdb file
5. index file (contains the index of atoms that we want to calculate)

##########################################

The RDF can be calculated between:
1. Backbone atoms of protein and Oxygen atoms of water molecule
2. Alpha carbon atoms of protein and Oxygen atoms of water molecule
3. Nitrogen atoms of protein backbone and Oxygen atoms of water molecule
4. Sidechain atoms of protein and Oxygen atoms of water molecule
5. Terminal carbon atoms of protein and Oxygen atoms of water molecule
